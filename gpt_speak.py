"""## Introduction
This code is a Python script for a conversational AI application. It uses the OpenAI API and other libraries such as termcolor, os, json, gTTS, and playsound to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Convert text to speech using gTTS and play it with playsound.
2. Load the API key from a JSON file and set it in the OpenAI API.
3. Ask a question to OpenAI's GPT-3 API, get the response, and print it.
4. Continuously take user input, convert it to speech, ask GPT-3 the input, get the response, and play it.
The conversational AI continues until the stop variable is set to True."""
